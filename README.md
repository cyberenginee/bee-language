## Introduction

Bee is an interpreted high-level programming language that is written by Python. Visit https://www.bee-lang.com to learn more about the language.

## Purpose

Bee is created for special and specific purposes.

* **Information security**: The main purpose of developing the Bee language is to focus on information security so that sensitive issues like information security can be strengthened. The security issues in the IT sector are increasing day by day and are undoubtedly going to face bigger challenges in the coming days. Technology is created to make people's daily work easier and easier. But if people's personal information is not safe and is subservient to someone else in an easy way, then it is very worrying. He can and does use this information to harm people, which is not desirable at all. Also more or less we all use different software for daily tasks and these software are developed with the help of different libraries or frameworks of a programming language. However, there are some security flaws in these libraries or frameworks. Because they are not made with security in mind. For example, since Python is open-source, different developers around the world create different libraries from time to time to develop the language. However, the library created by them is not tested at all. So later if that library is used by other developers in their project and if there is any security flaw in that library then hacker can easily take access to a system by doing damage using that formula. Again there is no guarantee that no malicious code is injected inside the developer who is building the library. So to get rid of these problems, Bee language is mainly developed where the security of a library will be checked before it is published, the developer who is creating the library will also check whether there is any malicious code hidden inside it and it will be used in various security research fields.
  
* **Learning**: Bee programming language has been architected in a very simple manner so that it becomes fun and easier to learn for any kind of person.

## How Does Bee Work?

"Compiler" and "Interpreter" are two types of translators whose job is to convert a programming language into machine code that a computer can understand, simply put, 0 and 1. Not just the Bee language, every high-level programming language is basically converted into machine code by a compiler or interpreter. Here, Bee is basically an interpreted language.

* Compiler: The code or program we write in the computer, the compiler reads the entire code together and then converts it into machine code. For example: C, C++, Java, and Erlang are compiled languages.

* Interpreter: The code or program we write on the computer, the interpreter reads each line and converts it into machine code without reading the entire code at once like a compiler. For example: Bee, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby are interpreted languages.

Also, there are several advantages and disadvantages between compilers and interpreters. Eg : Compiler takes less time to run a program than Interpreter. But the error handling of the interpreter is comparatively simpler than that of the compiler. Interpreter does not need to stress about memory management, it is done automatically. Because of this, the risk of memory error is much reduced in the interpreter as compared to the compiler.

## Who Needs Bee Language?
Bee is a brand new language and the language is still being researched. It is not yet fully ready for industrial use. Bee language may be a source of annoyance to many as it is still underdeveloped, but may be enjoyable for certain categories of people –

* People who are interested in learning programming
* People with prior knowledge of programming languages
* Very enthusiastic and willing to develop Bee language
* Information security researcher

The ocean of programming has a beginning but no end. And it is very important to be patient in this journey. In short, the language is only for those who love, work hard to learn and enjoy Bee programming.

## Limitation

Some limitations in Bee programming need to be resolved.

* Object-oriented programming
* File I/O

The work is in the process. We are expecting to get rid of these issues in the upcoming version. However, anyone is welcome to develop the language as this is an open-source project. Please, feel free to contribute.

## Contributing

It is an open-source project so that smart developers can contribute to the further development of the language. Development of Bee happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bug fixes and improvements.

## FAQ

Now the question will arise in the mind of many people that languages like Python, C, and C++ are being used in computer security, then whether Bee language should be used or not. In fact, every programming language is primarily designed to solve a specific problem. But Python, C, C++ none of them are designed with security in mind. Memory management in C and C++ requires a lot of speed. This is because it has to be done manually and can lead to serious security issues like buffer overflows if not managed properly. But B language does automatic memory management, due to which a developer does not have to worry about memory management. Now, talking about Python, it is undoubtedly a very popular language. However, most Python projects rely on third-party libraries. If these libraries have security vulnerabilities, it creates an entry point for hackers. Besides, the heart of security is cryptography. Python also has a lot of nice libraries for cryptography. However, it is not easy to use and there is no guarantee that the people creating these libraries are safe. As a result, if these libraries cannot be used properly and key management cannot be done properly, the developer has to face a lot of trouble. So the B language aims to make something as important as cryptography simple and easy to use for a developer. However, the Bee language is very new and in its infancy. It needs proper development, i.e. there is still a lot of research to be done on it. But it is definitely not possible for me alone. That's why I've made it open-source so that anyone can make significant contributions to its continued development. Since the language is more security conscious, I believe that any code changes, library additions, or innovations should be included in the B language only after its security testing. In short, today the Bee language may be insignificant compared to other famous and popular languages. But one day maybe this language will go beyond as well as will play a major role in many important sectors of security.
